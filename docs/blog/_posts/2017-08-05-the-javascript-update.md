title: "The JavaScript Update"

version: "2.6.0"

One of the biggest updates to BaseWeb since the overhaul to the documentation in v2.5.0, this is the JavaScript update. Instead of giving examples for jQuery solutions for JavaScript dependent components, now I've included vanilla JavaScript for each component in source.

## What's Included?

Included now with BaseWeb are scripts for the following:

* [Utility](/docs/javascript/utility/)
* [Dismissible](/docs/javascript/dismissible/)
* [Dropdowns](/docs/javascript/dropdowns/)
* [Tabs](/docs/javascript/tabs/)
* [Off-Canvas](/docs/javascript/offcanvas/)

Along with these components, there's been some improvements to the documentation for legibility and usability. Additional features include a focus on using BaseWeb via NPM and a streamlined way to include chuncks of BaseWeb via `@import` partials.
