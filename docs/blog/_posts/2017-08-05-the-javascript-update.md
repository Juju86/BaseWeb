version: "2.6.0"

One of the biggest updates to BaseWeb since the overhaul to the documentation in v2.5.0, this is the JavaScript update. I've written all the JavaScript dependent component scripts which are now included in your download of BaseWeb. Also included in is a brand new icons system featuring the simply beautiful open source icon set [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) by [Cole Bemis](http://colebemis.com/). I'm really excited about this update and I believe it sets a new standard of quality and vision for BaseWeb.

## JavaScript

Instead of giving examples for jQuery solutions for JavaScript dependent components, now I've included vanilla JavaScript for each component in source. Included now with BaseWeb are scripts for the following:

* [Utility](/docs/javascript/utility/)
* [Dismissible](/docs/javascript/dismissible/)
* [Dropdowns](/docs/javascript/dropdowns/)
* [Tabs](/docs/javascript/tabs/)
* [Off-Canvas](/docs/javascript/offcanvas/)

## Icons

Icon systems and the way they are used on the web has been a constantly shifting landscape for the past few years. I wanted to make sure the method included in BaseWeb adheres to best practices. I feel like I've found that sweet spot of efficiency, quality and flexibility with SVG icons.

## Other Updates

Along with these components, there's been some improvements to the documentation for legibility and usability. Additional features include a focus on using BaseWeb via NPM and a streamlined way to include chuncks of BaseWeb via `@import` partials.
