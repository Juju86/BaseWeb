This has been a long awaited update for me and I'm so excited that it's finally here! BaseWeb 2.0 now features a freshly built Jekyll powered site. The time that this site is going to save me in documenting, communicating and maintaining BaseWeb is going to enable me to focus on core features and continue adding component blocks.

One of my favorite additions is finally having a development log. This will enable me to talk a lot more about project decisions, upcoming features, goals and communicate with users more easily.

Here are the next few component blocks I'll be work on next:

* Modals
* Tabs
* Pagination
* Tooltips

A few things I also want to improve on with BaseWeb are:

* Including a way to use BaseWeb with package managers. This is something I'll need to research more of, but I think the easier I can make this project to up and running, the better.
* A way to create a custom download of BaseWeb with toggle-able components.
* I'd like to create a set of example templates using BaseWeb. This would function as both examples of how to put this project into practice, as well as unit tests that I can reference when larger changes are made.

I'm very passionate about this project. I've been pouring my knowledge of front-end development into it for years and it's been a huge learning experience for me. But I'm under no delusion in thinking that it's perfect, or even that it ever will be. I would love some input from my fellow developers and users. Let me know what you like about it, and what you hate. I'd love to hear what you think.
