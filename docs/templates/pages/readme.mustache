## Documentation
Documentation is currently being worked on and you can view them if you clone or download the repo. There will also be an online version at [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/).

---

## To-Do

* Use ems for sizing typography, margins and padding.
* Add some form of change or development log, similar to [Cargo Devlog](http://cargocollective.com/devlog).
* Incorporate [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) node module for use with the devlog and readme.
* `npm install` latest versions of node packages and fix any issues with build scripts.
* Setup auto deployment for docs to [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/).

---

## Build Scripts

BaseWeb uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Jake](http://jakejs.com/) for building both the source and docs. The build scripts themselves are written specifically for BaseWeb, but they are modular so you're free to modify and use them in your own scripts.

### Dependencies

* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) by downloading the `.pkg` file.
* Install [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake) globally `sudo npm install -g jake`
* Install [Jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) for the image optimizer to work. With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install jpeg`

### Node Packages

* Run `sudo npm install` (Should be run every time a new module is added)
* You should now be able to start running jake tasks!

### Jake tasks

* `jake build:scss`   Compiles and minifies SCSS
* `jake build:js`     Compiles and minifies JS
* `jake build:docs`   Build documentation
* `jake build:img`    Optimizes global images
* `jake watch`        Watch for change to files and rebuild if they change
