## Documentation

### Upcoming Features
Upcoming features and updates to BaseWeb documentation:

* Incorporate [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) node module for use with the devlog, blog and readme.

## Build Scripts

BaseWeb uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Jake](http://jakejs.com/) for building both the source and docs. The build scripts themselves are written specifically for BaseWeb, but they are modular so you're free to modify and use them in your own scripts.

### Dependencies

* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) by downloading the `.pkg` file.
* Install [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake) globally `sudo npm install -g jake`.
* Install [Jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) for the image optimizer to work. With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install jpeg`

### Node Packages
Run `npm install` to install required node modules for build scripts. This is the following node stack used to build BaseWeb and related files:

| `mustache`     | `2.0.0`    |
| `imagemin`     | `3.1.0`    |
