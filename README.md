## Documentation
Documentation is currently being worked on and you can view them if you clone or download the repo. There will also be an online version at [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/).

### Upcoming Features
Upcoming features and updates to BaseWeb documentation:

* Add some form of change or development log, similar to [Cargo Devlog](http://cargocollective.com/devlog).
* Add a blog to highlight new features and post tutorials.
* Incorporate [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) node module for use with the devlog, blog and readme.
* Setup auto deployment for docs to [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/).

## Build Scripts

BaseWeb uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Jake](http://jakejs.com/) for building both the source and docs. The build scripts themselves are written to be super flexible. The configurations are all setup using `jake-config.js` and can be adjusted as need for your own purposes.

### Node Packages
Run `npm install` to install required node modules for build scripts. This is the following node stack used to build BaseWeb assets and documentation files:

| Node Modules   | Versions   | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `node-watch`   | `0.3.4`    | Used in handling the watch task |
| `node-sass`    | `2.1.1`    | Used for compiling and minifying src and doc CSS from SCSS files |
| `uglify-js`    | `2.4.19`   | Used to compile and minify our JavaScript files |
| `imagemin`     | `3.1.0`    | Used to optimize our image files |
| `mustache`     | `2.0.0`    | Used to build our HTML files for docs, examples and readme |

*Keep in mind that if you use the imagemin module, [Jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) should be installed globally. You can install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using: `brew install jpeg`*

### Jake Tasks
The following tasks are available for building BaseWeb and related files:

| Jake Tasks        | Description                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `jake build:scss` | Compiles and minifies SCSS                           |
| `jake build:js`   | Compiles and minifies JavaScript                     |
| `jake build:img`  | Optimizes images                                     |
| `jake build:docs` | Build documentation                                  |
| `jake watch`      | Watch for change to files and rebuild if they change |

### Cusomizing Jake Tasks
The build scripts for BaseWeb are easy to adapt to your own projects. All tasks are setup using the `jake-config.js` as a configuration file. Each of the node modules that are used have a custom jake wrapper to interface with more easily. These are all the options you can adjust for Build and Watch tasks:

```js
module.exports = {
  
  // Each object inside of the build array is output as a task under the namespace 'build'.
  build: [
    { ... }
  ],
  
  // Each object inside of the watch array is output as a watch task.
  watch: [
    { ... }
  ]
  
}
```

#### Build Tasks

```js
// General Build Tasks
build: [
  {
    task: '...',
    desc: '...',
    module: '...',
    options: [{...}]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `task` | `string` | The jake task name. As a build task, this will be called on using the build namespace. E.g. `jake build:youKey`. |
| `desc` | `string` | A description for your task. This appears when you list your tasks using `jake -ls`. |
| `module` (optional) | `string` | The module you want to use for this task. If omitted, your key will be used instead. If your key does not match an existing node module, this field is required. |
| `options` | `object` | The options that are passed to the node module. |

*A build task is generated for every object in the build array. You can also use `jake build` to run all build scripts.*

#### Watch Tasks

```js
// General Watch Tasks
watch: [
  {
    task: '...',
    files: [...],
    ignore: [...]
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `task` | `string` | The key is directly linked to build tasks. If a watch key of `docs` is created, when it triggers the `build:docs` task gets fired. |
| `files` | `array` | Files or directories to watch. |
| `ignore` (optional) | `array` | An array of files to ignore. This is helpful if a build task generates a file within a directory that is also being watched. |

*A watch task is generated for every object in the watch array.*
