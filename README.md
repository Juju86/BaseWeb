#BaseWeb
A front-end CSS framework written in LESS.

I'm currently working on the full documentation and overall this project is still changing a lot while I play around with things and figure out how I work best using this framework.

If you want to try it out yourself, just compile the framework from the bootstrap.less file in `assets/css/less/` directory. Ideally, the framework should be compiled in the baseweb.css file in the `css` directory but you can also just include the `less.js` file in the header and compile it client side. Just double check your assets paths to make sure nothing breaks depending on your method.

There is still a lot that might change on this project and still a lot of testing to do so use at your own risk.

For more information on how to use LESS or how to compile LESS files, see [the official LESS website](http://lesscss.org/).
