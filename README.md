## About
BaseWeb is a fresh SCSS front-end development framework and library built to help keep your projects simple, organized and responsive.

* Modals
* Tabs
* Pagination
* Tooltips

## Documentation
Documentation can be found at [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/). A copy of the docs are also included when downloading this repo. If you see any errors or problems with the docs, please feel free to open an issue ticket and I'll do my best to get things fixed. BaseWeb is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Upcoming Features
Upcoming features and updates to BaseWeb documentation:

* Add some form of change or development log, similar to [Cargo Devlog](http://cargocollective.com/devlog).
* Add a blog to highlight new features and post tutorials.
* Incorporate [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) node module for use with the devlog, blog and readme.
* Setup auto deployment for docs to [http://getbaseweb.com/](http://getbaseweb.com/).

## Build Scripts

Build scripts have been rebuilt from `Jake` => `Gulp`. Need to write up some documentation for the new tasks (coming soon).
